Ok so I'm working on a project called the NBA hub and we have created a API with information of players, teams, etc I want to have a base.html that has links to tems, players and conferences pages
so I'm using javascript to get the information from the API by fetching the information but first  I wan to be able to make everything good without making the requests so my player.html is going to lhave a table that displays the player information and every player has a redirect link called edit that takes you to a page in which you can edit their information. and they also have a checkbox that when clicked it removes the player for the table . In addtion right at top of the table there's an add button that will allows you to add a new player by redirecting to a page that load a form with the information of the player and you can edit it by sumbitting the form and there's a link to go back to player in adittion as an additional fiture I would like to add a search box that you can find the player you want that's for player and every change made into player should also show in teams and conference the same that if I remove a team the team doesn't show up in the teams page which is the next thing I wanna go to so in the teams page there's going to be a table that will show the teams and once a team is selcted it will show you the players and the page will know which player is on each team by their team abbreviation that's connected to the players table also if the team is removed the players abbreviation will be set to FRE meaning that player is not anymore in a team and it belongs to the Fre team that is also in the table and displays the the names of the teams and has a dropdown option that shows the player in that team with the information about the players the team page also has a option that you can add a team having a new unique requires abbreviation so if a player is changed to be in that abbreviation it will be added to the team and you will be able to see the player
